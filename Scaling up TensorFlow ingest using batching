Challenge Exercise
Create a neural network that is capable of finding the volume of a cylinder given the radius of its base (r) and its height (h). Assume that the radius and height of the cylinder are both in the range 0.5 to 2.0. Unlike in the challenge exercise for b_estimator.ipynb, assume that your measurements of r, h and V are all rounded off to the nearest 0.1. Simulate the necessary training dataset. This time, you will need a lot more data to get a good predictor.

Hint (highlight to see):

Create random values for r and h and compute V. Then, round off r, h and V (i.e., the volume is computed from the true value of r and h; it's only your measurement that is rounded off). Your dataset will consist of the round values of r, h and V. Do this for both the training and evaluation datasets.

Now modify the "noise" so that instead of just rounding off the value, there is up to a 10% error (uniformly distributed) in the measurement followed by rounding off.

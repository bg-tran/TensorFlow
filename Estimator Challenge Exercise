Challenge Exercise
Create a neural network that is capable of finding the volume of a cylinder given the radius of its base (r) and its height (h). Assume that the radius and height of the cylinder are both in the range 0.5 to 2.0. Simulate the necessary training dataset.

Hint (highlight to see):

The input features will be r and h and the label will be  𝜋𝑟2ℎ  Create random values for r and h and compute V. Your dataset will consist of r, h and V. Then, use a DNN regressor. Make sure to generate enough data.
